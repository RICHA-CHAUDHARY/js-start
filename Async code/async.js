// javascript = it is synchronous(line by line code execute) // it is single threaded // it is default

// execution context - execute one line of code at a time. // each operation waits for last one to complete before executing.

// 1. console log-1
// 2. console log-2  // call stack and Memory heap

// Blocking Code - block the flow of diagram/ read file Sync
// Non blocking code - does not block execution / read file Async
